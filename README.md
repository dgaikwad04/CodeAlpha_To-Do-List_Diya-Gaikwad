CODEALPHA_TO-DO-LIST_DIYA RAJENDRA GAIKWAD

It is a To-Do-List the technologies I have used are HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
It is developed in such a way that even after we refresh the To-Do-List website and we have already make a list of tasks, even after refreshing or reopening the same To-Do-List the data which we have already added will be saved. and not been deleted or removed.
If we directly click on Add button the Website shows an alert to us.
